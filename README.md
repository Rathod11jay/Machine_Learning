Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data and making predictions. It involves designing algorithms that automatically improve through experience.

Key Concepts:
  - Supervised Learning: Models trained on labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).
  - Unsupervised Learning: Models trained on unlabeled data to find patterns (e.g., clustering).
  - Reinforcement Learning: Models learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards).

Popular ML Algorithms:
  - Regression Models: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
  - Classification Models: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
  - Neural Networks: Deep Learning, CNNs, RNNs

Tools & Libraries:
  - Python: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
  - Data Processing: pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
